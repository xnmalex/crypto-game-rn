## üß™ Unit Testing

Key business logic like `handleTrade()` is tested with Jest:

- ‚úÖ Valid buy/sell updates
- ‚úÖ Balance enforcement
- ‚úÖ ID and timestamp generation
- ‚úÖ Zustand store state verification

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.


## Step 1: Build and run your app

Install dependencies from `package.json`
```sh
npm install
```

you can manually start the emulator from command line

```sh
 emulator -avd "your emulator name for eg: Pixel_9_Pro_XL"
```

open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```


### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
